      <p class="tiempos-text">
        I've been working as a web developer and designer for the past seven years. In that time I've been lucky enough to work up and down the stack with some really amazing people. Being able to learn from and with both colleagues and clients is one of the many reasons I love doing what I do.

        I'm very curious generally and passionate about software development more specifically. I like learning, and enjoy sharing what I learn as I learn it.

          Working at Stacktrace allowed me to work on a team, that itself was part of a very large organisation; hundreds of developers trying to work together. This has been an invaluable lesson in some of the challenges that can present when large, distributed organisations have to move in one direction.

          This was my first leadership role. The team started with only me and grew to include six junior and senior engineers. The team was great, so I spent as much time as possible ensuring we had a shared understanding of upcoming work and how it related to the problems we were solving.

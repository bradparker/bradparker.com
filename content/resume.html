        Resume
      </h1>

      <p class="tiempos-text">
        I've been working as a web developer and designer for the past seven years. In that time I've been lucky enough to work up and down the stack with some really amazing people. Being able to learn from and with both colleagues and clients is one of the many reasons I love doing what I do.

        Skills
      </h2>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I'm curious and try to keep an open mind. Changing careers from music education, to design, to software engineering has made me comfortable with being a beginner.

        Front end web development
      </h3>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I've done a few versions of front end development, from Wordpress themes to universal React applications.
      </p>

        Markup
      </h4>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I've been writing HTML since 1996 when I put together a few dinky Geocities sites. I always have the generated HTML in mind when using tools that abstract over it, this includes everything from Markdown to React. I feel like that can be helpful, there's a lot that the browser can help you with if you give it the right hints. From reasonably simple stuff like viewport meta through to making sure that custom form controls remain usable for keyboard and screen reader users.

        Interaction
      </h4>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        JavaScript is the language I've used most. For a long time it served as the language I thought about problems in. I've used it to write reasonably large single page applications. I wrote some <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/Outfitio/outfit-template-how-to">documentation</a> for an early version of one of these single page apps which might be illustrative.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I first started to use React extensively in early 2015. We chose to replace <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://outfit.io">Outfit's</a> Angular 1 prototype (which I had also written) with a Rails app decorated with React components. We were even able to achieve progressive enhancement by using a pretty nifty <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails">gem</a> to render components on the server side as part of Rail's usual view rendering process. I thought that it was all pretty amazing.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I got write a lot of code using React at everydayhero. All new user interfaces were written in React, we had our own <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/hui">component</a> <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/react-widgets">libraries</a> and <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/boiler-room-builder">tooling</a> to make building universal apps and static sites a bit easier.

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        Modern CSS is <em class="i">amazing</em>. The tools we have now for managing layout, for example, work wonderfully and the consistency across browsers is better than ever. That being said name spacing is still hard. I've worked with a few different convention-based solutions like Block Element Modifier and Atomic CSS. I've also worked with tools that try to automate scoping like CSS Modules and CSS in JS.

        Back end web development
      </h3>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        At both NetEngine and everydayhero I got to kick off brand new Ruby on Rails apps and maintain well-used older ones. A Rails application that has stuck close to convention can be a very pleasant thing to work on.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I've deployed a few web services in Node.js, it went well. It's good to have an ecosystem of full of packages which all compose pretty nicely.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        Despite not using it professionally, over the past few years I've written a lot of Haskell. At Stacktrace we maintained regular Friday afternoon learning sessions, so far we've worked through <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/stacktracehq/cis194-exercises">Brent Yorgey's CIS 194 lecture series</a> and <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/stacktracehq/fp-course">QFPL's three day functional programming workshop</a>. Recently I implemented Thinkster's <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/bradparker/servant-beam-realworld-example-app/">RealWorld API specification in Haskell</a>, as a fun learning exercise.

        Design
      </h3>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I got my start in web development through being hired as a designer for a software company. I have designed user interfaces, visual identities and promotional material. I really love great typography and good, sound structure.

          Working at Stacktrace allowed me to work on a team, that itself was part of a very large organisation; hundreds of developers trying to work together. This has been an invaluable lesson in some of the challenges that can present when large, distributed organisations have to move in one direction.

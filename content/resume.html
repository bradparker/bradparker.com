        Resume
      </h1>

      <p class="tiempos-text">
        I've been working as a web developer and designer for the past seven years. In that time I've been lucky enough to work up and down the stack with some really amazing people. Being able to learn from and with both colleagues and clients is one of the many reasons I love doing what I do.
      </p>

        Skills
      </h2>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I'm curious and try to keep an open mind. Changing careers from music education, to design, to software engineering has made me comfortable with being a beginner.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        Below I'll summarise my experience with the technologies I've used most or am most passionate about.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f5 b founders-grotesk mt3">
        HTML and CSS (including generators like SASS and CSS Next)
      </h3>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        Like a lot of people I had a Geocities site when I was around ten years old (I wrote all tags in SHOUTY CASE, which I miss to some extent). Later, when working on front ends professionally, I had to learn about taming the complexity of CSS through preprocessors like SASS and patterns like BEM and Atomic CSS.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f5 b founders-grotesk mt3">
        JavaScript (including Node.js)
      </h3>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        JavaScript is the language I've used most. For a long time it served as the language I thought about problems in. I've been writing it professionally since I started out in web development.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I've used it to write <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/boiler-room-builder">developer tooling</a>, reasonably large single page applications and back end web services. I wrote some <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/Outfitio/outfit-template-how-to">documentation</a> for an early version of one of these single page apps which might be illustrative.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f5 b founders-grotesk mt3">
        React
      </h3>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I first started to use React extensively in early 2015. We chose to replace <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://outfit.io">Outfit's</a> Angular 1 prototype (which I had also written) with a Rails app decorated with React components. We were even able to achieve progressive enhancement by using a pretty nifty <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails">gem</a> to render components on the server side as part of Rail's usual view rendering process. I thought that it was all pretty amazing.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I got write a lot of code using React at everydayhero. All new user interfaces were written in React, we had our own <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/hui">component</a> <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/react-widgets">libraries</a> and <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/boiler-room-builder">tooling</a> to make building universal apps and static sites a bit easier.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f5 b founders-grotesk mt3">
        Ruby (including Rails)
      </h3>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        At both NetEngine and everydayhero I got to both kick off brand new Rails apps and maintain well-used older ones.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f5 b founders-grotesk mt3">
        Haskell
      </h3>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        Despite not using it professionally, over the past few years I've written a lot of Haskell. At Stacktrace we've maintained regular Friday afternoon learning sessions, so far we've worked through <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/stacktracehq/cis194-exercises">Brent Yorgey's CIS 194 lecture series</a> and <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/stacktracehq/fp-course">QFPL's three day functional programming workshop</a>. Recently I implemented Thinkster's <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/bradparker/servant-beam-realworld-example-app/">RealWorld API specification in Haskell</a>, as a fun learning exercise.

          Working at Stacktrace allowed me to work on a team, that itself was part of a very large organisation; hundreds of developers trying to work together. This has been an invaluable lesson in some of the challenges that can present when large, distributed organisations have to move in one direction.

          This was my first leadership role. The team started with only me and grew to include six junior and senior engineers. The team was great, so I spent as much time as possible ensuring we had a shared understanding of upcoming work and how it related to the problems we were solving.

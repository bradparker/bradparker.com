        Resume
      </h1>

      <p class="tiempos-text">
        I've been working as a web developer and designer for the past seven years. In that time, I've been lucky enough to work up and down the stack with some really amazing people. Learning from and with colleagues and clients is one of the many reasons I love doing what I do.
      </p>

        Skills
      </h2>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I've worked in range of positions, as an individual-contributor (design and development), as a technical leader and as a project organiser.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I'm curious and try to keep an open mind. Changing careers from music education, to design, to software engineering has made me comfortable with being a beginner.

        Front end web development
      </h3>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I've done a few types of front end development, from Wordpress themes to universal React applications.

        Markup
      </h4>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I've been writing HTML since 1996 when I put together some dinky Geocities sites. I always have the generated HTML in mind when using tools that abstract over it, this includes everything from Markdown to React. I think this is helpful. The browser can help you out a lot if you give it the right hints, from simple stuff like viewport meta through to keeping custom form controls usable for keyboard and screen reader users.

        Interaction
      </h4>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        JavaScript is the language I have the most experience with. For a long time it was the language in which I thought about problems. I've used it to write reasonably large single page applications. This <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/Outfitio/outfit-template-how-to">documentation</a> for an early version of one of these single page apps might be illustrative.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I started to use React extensively in early 2015. We chose to replace <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://outfit.io">Outfit's</a> Angular 1 prototype (which I also wrote) with a Rails app decorated with React components. We even achieved progressive enhancement by using a pretty nifty <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails">gem</a> to render components on the server side as part of Rails' usual view rendering process. I thought that it was all pretty amazing.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I got write a lot of code using React at everydayhero. All new user interfaces were written in React, and we had our own <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/hui">component</a> <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/react-widgets">libraries</a> and <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/boiler-room-builder">tooling</a> to make building universal apps and static sites a bit easier.

        Presentation
      </h4>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        Modern CSS is <em class="i">amazing</em>. For example, the tools we have now for managing layout work wonderfully and the consistency across browsers is better than ever. That being said name spacing is still hard. I've worked with a few different convention-based solutions like Block Element Modifier and Atomic CSS. I've also worked with tools that try to automate scoping like CSS Modules and CSS in JS. Another tricky bit is code reuse. I've used SASS to get variables and mixins, I've used PostCSS-cssnext to get something quite like custom properties in browsers that didn't yet support them, CSS in JS also works really well here.

        Back end web development
      </h3>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I've been responsible for the operation of production applications. This includes their instrumentation and diagnosis of what went wrong with them. I also really enjoy making applications easy to run in development and deploy to different production-like environments.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        At both NetEngine and everydayhero I got to kick off brand new Ruby on Rails apps and maintain well-used older ones. A Rails application that has stuck close to convention can be a very pleasant thing to work on.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I've deployed a few web services in Node.js. These have been of a few different flavours: view-rendering, queue-working, http-api-ing and combinations thereof. It's good to have an ecosystem of full of packages which all compose nicely.
      </p>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I've written a lot of Haskell over the past few years, despite not using it professionally. I co-facilitated regular Friday afternoon learning sessions at Stacktrace. We worked through <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/stacktracehq/cis194-exercises">Brent Yorgey's CIS 194 lecture series</a> and <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/stacktracehq/fp-course">QFPL's three day functional programming workshop</a>. Recently, I implemented Thinkster's <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/bradparker/servant-beam-realworld-example-app/">RealWorld API specification in Haskell</a> as a fun learning exercise.

        Design
      </h3>

      <p class="tiempos-text mt2">
        I got my start in web development through being hired as a designer for a software company. I have designed user interfaces, visual identities and promotional material. I really love great typography and good, sound structure. If you'd like to see more I have a <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="/static/brad_parker_folio_2013.pdf">portfolio</a> you can check out.

          Working at Stacktrace allowed me to work on a team that was embedded in a very large organisation; hundreds of developers trying to work together. This has been an invaluable lesson in some of the challenges that can present when large, distributed organisations have to move collectively in one direction.

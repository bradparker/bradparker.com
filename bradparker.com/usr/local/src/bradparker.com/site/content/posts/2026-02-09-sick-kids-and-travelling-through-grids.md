Some time last year, during one of the many bouts of minor illness which strike children who attend daycare or kindergarten, our child was laid up on the couch watching episode after episode of [Go Jetters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Jetters). We must've watched every episode then hosted on ABC iView at least three or four times. I wasn't feeling too well myself so joined in on the binge and after a while my head started wandering off down funny furrows.

The show centres around visiting famous places. Somehow the hapless antagonist (he's not intentionally malicious) is always there and shenanigans ensue. One episode features the ancient city of Timgad, in modern-day Algeria, and in watching it for perhaps the fourth time in a single day I wondered if Timgad might help me scaffold some notes about binomial coefficients. So here we are.

  Resume
</h1>

<p class="tiempos-text mt4">
  I've been working as a web developer and designer for about the past nine years. In that time, I've been lucky enough to work up and down the stack with some really amazing people. Learning from, and with, colleagues and clients is one of the many reasons I love doing what I do.
</p>

<hr class="ba-0 bt b--near-white mt4" />

<h2 class="f3 b founders-grotesk lh-solid ma0 mv4">
  Skills
</h2>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  I've worked in range of positions, as an individual-contributor (design and development), as a technical leader and as a project organiser.
</p>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  I'm curious and try to keep an open mind. Changing careers from music education, to design, to software engineering has made me comfortable with being a beginner.
</p>

<h3 class="f4 b founders-grotesk lh-solid ma0 mt4 mb3">
  Front end web development
</h3>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  I've done a few types of front end development, from WordPress themes to universal React applications.
</p>

<h4 class="f5 b founders-grotesk lh-solid ma0 mt4 mb3">
  Markup
</h4>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  I've been writing HTML since 1996 when I was putting together dinky Geocities sites. I always have the generated HTML in mind when using tools that abstract over it, this includes everything from Markdown to React. I think this is helpful. The browser can help you out a lot if you give it the right hints, from simple stuff like viewport meta through to keeping custom form controls usable for keyboard and screen-reader users.
</p>

<h4 class="f5 b founders-grotesk lh-solid ma0 mt4 mb3">
  Interaction
</h4>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  JavaScript is the language I have the most experience with. For a long time it was the language in which I thought about problems. I've used it to write reasonably large single page applications.
</p>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  I started to use React extensively in early 2015. We chose to replace <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://outfit.io">Outfit's</a> Angular 1 prototype with a Rails app decorated with React components. We even achieved progressive enhancement by using a pretty nifty <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails">gem</a> to render components on the server side as part of Rails' usual view rendering process. I thought that it was all pretty amazing.
</p>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  I got write a lot of code using React at everydayhero. All new user interfaces were written in React, and we had our own <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/hui">component</a> <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/react-widgets">libraries</a> and <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/everydayhero/boiler-room-builder">tooling</a> to make building universal apps and static sites a bit easier.
</p>

<h4 class="f5 b founders-grotesk lh-solid ma0 mt4 mb3">
  Presentation
</h4>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  Modern CSS is <em class="i">amazing</em>. For example, the tools we have now for managing layout work wonderfully and the consistency across browsers is better than ever. That being said name spacing is still hard. I've worked with a few different convention-based solutions like Block Element Modifier and Atomic CSS. I've also worked with tools that try to automate scoping like CSS Modules and CSS in JS. Another tricky bit is code reuse. I've used SASS to get variables and mix-ins, I've used PostCSS-cssnext to get something quite like custom properties in browsers that didn't yet support them, CSS in JS also works really well here.
</p>

<h3 class="f4 b founders-grotesk lh-solid ma0 mt4 mb3">
  Fullish-stack web development
</h3>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  I've been responsible for the deployment and operation of production applications and services. This includes instrumenting them and then using that instrumentation to diagnose any issues they may have. It has also included developing or choosing and implementing tools and processes to help my colleagues ship faster and safer.
</p>

<h4 class="f5 b founders-grotesk lh-solid ma0 mt4 mb3">
  Application frameworks and ecosystems
</h4>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  At both NetEngine and everydayhero I got to kick off brand-new Ruby on Rails apps and maintain well-used older ones. A Rails application that has stuck close to convention can be a very pleasant thing to work on.
</p>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  I've deployed a few web services in Node.js. These have been of a few different flavours: view-rendering, queue-working, http-api-ing and combinations thereof. It's good to have an ecosystem full of packages which all compose nicely.
</p>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  One of the tasks undertaken by my team at Genie Solutions was to replace a couple of services written in Go. Being that we had no-one with Go experience on the team I took it on myself to learn as much as I needed to make the changes we needed during that transition.
</p>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  I've written a lot of Haskell over the past few years, despite not using it professionally. I co-facilitated regular Friday afternoon learning sessions at Stacktrace. We worked through <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/stacktracehq/cis194-exercises">Brent Yorgey's CIS 194 lecture series</a> and <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/stacktracehq/fp-course">QFPL's three day functional programming workshop</a>. Recently, I implemented Thinkster's <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="https://github.com/bradparker/servant-beam-realworld-example-app/">RealWorld API specification in Haskell</a> as a fun learning exercise.
</p>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  My <em class="i">real job</em> at Stacktrace was to work on an event-registration system. This was implemented as ASP.NET app, written in C# and deployed on Azure infrastructure.
</p>

<h4 class="f5 b founders-grotesk lh-solid ma0 mt4 mb3">
  Deployment
</h4>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  The teams and technologies I've worked with while deploying these apps has changed a lot over time. Initially we shipped using Capistrano straight onto dedicated, lovingly tended, EC2 instances running Ubuntu. Later we built docker images, pushed them to a registry and then pulled them onto CoreOS servers provisioned by Ansible. Later still we ran Consul, Vault and Nomad clusters on Centos servers all provisioned by Terraform and Salt. More recently we've been migrating to AWS Lambda and Fargate services provisioned using CloudFormation.
</p>

<h4 class="f5 b founders-grotesk lh-solid ma0 mt4 mb3">
  Observability
</h4>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  I've used a range of monitoring and observability tools such as Datadog, Librato, Amazon's CloudWatch and the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). I love logs (structured), believing that it's nearly impossible to have too many.
</p>
<h3 class="f4 b founders-grotesk lh-solid ma0 mt4 mb3">
  Design
</h3>

<p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  I got my start in web development through being hired as a designer for a software company. I have designed user interfaces, visual identities and promotional material. I really love great typography and good, sound structure. Should you like to see more I have a <a class="link hover-dark-green underline" href="/static/brad_parker_folio_2013.pdf">portfolio</a> you can check out.

  <p class="tiempos-text">
    Five Good Friends uses Basecamp's <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> project management methodology. Every eight weeks we split up into small, specially formed teams of about three or four people. These teams are tasked with solving problems and, importantly, trusted to figure how best to solve them. The time needed to learn about the problem is built in. Often that can even result in refocusing the problem itself. The whole process is very collaborative and dynamic, I love it.
  </p>

  <p class="tiempos-text mt3">
    Another enjoyable feature of Five Good Friends engineering culture is a focus on asynchronous communication. We write medium length almost blog posts to each other about problems we're trying to figure out, as well as cool and interesting things we've found. We pour a lot of information into GitHub pull request descriptions as well as our individual commit messages. I've been working fully remote now for over a year and it's been working wonderfully.
  </p>

  <p class="tiempos-text mt3">
  Finally, further to the idea of "trust", we're really trusted to apply our expertise. In my first two "cycles" (eight week blocks of work on a particular problem) I was asked to make some recommendations regarding front-end architecture. I was given scope to really prove out a solution I wasn't 100% sure of. I'd not tried it before, but I thought it, or something like it, would be suitable for Five Good Friends specifically. We're now in the process of rolling out that architecture (<a href="https://github.com/github/view_component">ViewComponent</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>, plus some utilities to tie them together) across the whole codebase and so far everyone seems really happy with it.

    At the time of my starting at Genie Solutions it had just gone through a period of rapid growth. They were looking to make many changes simultaneously: the nature of the business, the way they worked, and the tools they used to build and deploy software.

  <p class="tiempos-text mt3">
    As a senior developer I saw it as my responsibility to act as an intermediary between leadership and engineers, both on my team and others. I would try to advocate for solutions to pain-points raised by engineers. I would try to establish patterns and practices more in line with those wanted by the engineering leadership team.

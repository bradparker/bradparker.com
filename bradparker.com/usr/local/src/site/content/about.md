I live in Brisbane, Australia with my partner [Alicia](https://www.instagram.com/thecorrectalicia/) and very small dog Quintin (pictured).

These days I mostly make [software](/tags/development), for a while I mostly [designed](/tags/design) things and prior to both I mostly played music.

I've been making software professionally for about seven years and I really love it. I believe software has this empowering potential, I believe everyone should be able to understand it if they want to. This means I prefer open and accessible tools and standards wherever possible. It also means I try to learn in the open, sharing what I learn as I learn it. If you'd like to know more about my history in this area you can read my [resume](/resume).

I can be found in some of the usual online places, say g'day if you have any questions about anything you've seen here.
